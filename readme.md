Assignment for [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/). Might as well have fun while doing this.

- [ ] use simplest technique possible (e.g: forms, checkboxes instead of javascript). just get it working and move on
- [ ] (optional) organize this into table
- [ ] deploy to github pages (can just create gh-pages branch? idk)

## Rough ideas for what I'll make:
*final implementtion might be a little different*

### [anime-dubbed-by-kanye](./anime-dubbed-by-kanye/)
- get random kanye quote
- get random anime screenshot or image
- place quote inside image (w/ css) to look like subtitles

#### APIs used:
- <https://kanye.rest/>
- not decided yet

### [quote-guesser-GOT](./quote-guesser-GOT/)
- get random quote
- either use text input or select from multiple choices to guess who said it 

#### APIs used:
- <https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/>

### [willem-dafriend-willem-dafoe](./willem-dafriend-willem-dafoe/)
- get 2 characters that are affiliated w/ Green Goblin
- checkboxes for Friend or Foe
- note: *not necessary that there will always be one friend and one foe. can be 2 friends, 2 foes etc.*
